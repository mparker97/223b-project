SHARED JOURNAL; DAY 0

Alice (ID 0):
[START ORACLE]Hello, my name is Alice. Today, I exchanged keys with Bob, and now we can talk secretly!
I can't wait for us to share stories in private![END ORACLE]

Bob (ID 1):
Hi, I'm Bob, but you can call be "Robert" for short.
I've been talking with Alice regarding cryptography.
It's pretty neat.

Charlie (ID 2):
Greetings. This is Charlie speaking.
I've always been a journaler, so hearing about this new shared journal thing was exciting!
I can't wait to see how well it works.
Oh, I also like ASCII art:

			 _____ _                _ _      
			/  __ \ |              | (_)     
			| /  \/ |__   __ _ _ __| |_  ___

			| \__/\ | | | (_| | |  | | |  __/
			\_____/_| |_|\__,_|_|  |_|_|\___|

Dave (ID 3):
Day 0, 7:00am. Calm and cool weather, dew on the grass. No sign of intelligent life.
David here. Welcome to the Outback.
I've discovered this program that lets me edit files with others. I'm now partaking in a shared journal.
Let's hope this software isn't total crud.
