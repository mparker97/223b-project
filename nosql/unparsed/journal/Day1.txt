SHARED JOURNAL; DAY 1

Alice (ID 0):
I finally get the chance to test out some fun key exchange protocols with Bob!
This first one we are trying is called "Diffie-Hellman", and it sounds awesome!
I can't believe we can cast out our keys to the world yet still have them be secure.
I sure hope no one finds a way to exploit this...

Bob (ID 1):
I tried the Diffie-Hellman key exchange today with Alice. It went well.

Charlie (ID 2):
Wow, Bob and Alice are fools.

I heard they were trying DH exchange, and I was able to install a watcher to intercept it.
Suckers don't know about man in the middle attacks!

Dave (ID 3):
Day 1, 9:21am. Sunny day today; few clouds in the sky, and definitely drier than yesterday. Still no sign of intelligent life.
The Outback sure is interesting.
This shared journal is alright, too.
