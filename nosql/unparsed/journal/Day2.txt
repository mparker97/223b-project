SHARED JOURNAL; DAY 2

Alice (ID 0):
What the hell?!?!
I've been talking to Bob through this secret encryption scheme, and my once good friend is now being a total jerk to me!
I don't know what has gotten in to him, but I've just about had it.

Bob (ID 1):
I don't know what is going on with Alice.
I'm telling her all these cool things that I did today, and she's acting all insulted for no reason.
What is going on?

Charlie (ID 2):
Ha; that's show them for leaving old Charles in the dust.

Dave (ID 3):
Day 2, 2:13pm. Sunny and hot today; blistering heat and even drier than yesterday. And still no sign of intelligent life.
The Outback sure is unforgiving.
This shared journal is shit, too, I've discovered.
